This chatbot responds to financial questions about three companies, Apple, Microsoft, and Tesla, from
10k filing from 2021 to 2023. This chatbot can answer seven predefined queries to include

1. What is sum Total Revenue of Apple for the period from 2021 to 2023?
2. What is the mean Net Income of Microsoft for the period from 2021 to 2023?

4. How is the trend for Average Cash Flow from Operating Activities over the Years?
5. How is the trend for Total Assets over the Years?
6. How does the net income of the company over the years look?
7. How do total liabilities by company over the years look?
8. How do total liabilities by company over the years look?

Amazingly, this is my first time going through an entire project life cycle. 

I started with data collection, structuring, cleaning, and analysis.
Saved the analysis results in the form of CSVs and PNGs that I further used to include in query-based logic 
to build pre-defined query responses for user input queries.

Limitations that I can think of are
1. Usability of chatbot for a commoner(this is my personal requirement though)
2. When scaled up, these can get messy,and  there can be an automation to build these pre-defined queries as well
3. The landing HTML page can be more interactive
