10k filing from 2021 to 2023. This chat bot can answer to seven predefined queries to include

5. How is the trend for Total Assets Over Years?
6. How does net income by company over years look like?
7. How do total liabilities by company over years look like?
8. How do total liabilities by company over years look like?

Amazingly this is my first time going through an entire project life-cycle. 

I started with data collection, structuring, cleaning, analysis.
Saved the analysis results in the form of csvs and pngs that I further used to include in query based logic 
to build pre-defined query responses for user input queries.

Limitations that I can think of are
1. Usability of chatbot for a commoner(this is my personal requirement though)
2. When scaled up, these can go messy, there can be an automation to build these pre defined queries as well
3. The landing html page can be more interactive
